Introduction to multi tenant applications
====================================================



What are multi tenant apps?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Multi tenant applications allow you to serve multiple customers with one install of the application. Each customer has their data completely isolated in such an architecture. Each customer is called a tenant.

Most modern Software as a Service applications are multi tenant. Whether it is Salesforce, Freshbooks, Zoho or Wordpress, most modern cloud based applications are delivered with a multi-tenant architecture.


The structure of this book
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this book we will take a single tenant application and re-architect it to be a multi tenant application. We will use a slightly modified Django polls app as our base.

There are multiple approaches for multi tenancy. We will look at the four most common ones.


The various approaches to multi tenancy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Shared database with shared schema
- Shared database with isolated schema
- Isolated database with a shared app server
- Completely isolated tenants using Docker

Shared database with shared schema
---------------------------------------

A single database keeps every tenant's data. A :code:`ForeignKey` in the tables identifies the tenant.

Shared database with isolated schema
---------------------------------------

A single database keeps every tenant's data. Each tenant's data is in a separate schema within the single database. The schema identifies the tenant and data tables do no have a FK to the tenant.


Isolated database with a shared app server
----------------------------------------------

Every tenant's data is in a separate database. The database identifies the tenant.


Completely isolated tenants using Docker
------------------------------------------

A new set of docker containers are launched for each tenant. Every tenant's data is in a separate database (which may or may not be running in container). A set of containers identifies the tenant.

In the next four chapters, we will look at each architecture in turn. Let's get started.
